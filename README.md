## Recommended Resolutions

### Common Desktop Resolutions

- 1920 x 1080
- 2560 x 1440
- 3840 x 2160

### Steam Deck Resolution

The Steam Deck has a unique resolution of **1280 √ó 800**, which can be approximated to a **720p**-like resolution.

### Base Resolutions for Pixel-Perfect Retro Feel

For these resolutions, **720p** serves as a common denominator. To achieve a retro, pixel-perfect aesthetic, we recommend the following base resolutions:

- **640 x 360**
- **320 x 180** (for a truly old-school feel)

If your target resolution is 1080p or higher, it can work with an intermediate base resolution such as:

- **384 √ó 216**

This approach allows for flexibility and maintains visual clarity across various display sizes.
